This repository hosts the **Draco AgentTech Synthesis Framework**, a versatile agentic AI architecture for real-time analysis, decision support, and synthesis across domains. It features two versions integrating Collective Predictive Coding (CPC), Agentic Neural Networks (ANN), and human-AI collaboration principles. As part of the **[Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster)**, Draco prioritizes ethical, adaptive, and transparent synergies.

**Elevator Pitch:** An advanced AI framework designed to navigate complexity. It deploys a team of specialized agents to rapidly gather, analyze, and synthesize vast information, delivering clear and reliable insights to support your critical decisions.

**Project Status & Vision:** This is a conceptual project consisting of prompt-based blueprints for advanced LLMs (e.g., Grok, GPT-4o, Claude). Simulations are illustrative and do not represent empirical claims. Last conceptual update: Oct 2025 (v1.1), refining clarity and incorporating analogs from recent research (e.g., arXiv:2508.14825 on agentic AI in HAC).

## Framework Versions: Choose Your Approach

Draco has evolved from GAAF prototypes into two general-purpose editions, with a unified version planned for the future. This diagram illustrates the evolution:

Draco offers two distinct versions, each tailored for different analytical needs. Choose the one that best fits your objective.

- [**Version 1 (with X-CII): The Guardian for Critical Decisions**](./prompts/en/draco-agenttech-synthesis-framework-x-cii-en.md)
  This version is your choice for tasks where **risk management, reliability, and accountability** are non-negotiable. It operates like a meticulous auditor, quantifying performance and minimizing the cost of errors.

  - **Use When You Need:**
    - **Risk-Sensitive Analysis:** To explicitly calculate and minimize the potential cost of wrong decisions (Expected Loss).
    - **Quantifiable Proof:** To evaluate performance using a unified metric for Quality, Efficiency, and Safety (X-CII).
    - **High-Stakes Reliability:** For domains like healthcare, finance, or legal research where accuracy is paramount.
  - **Output Focus:** Delivers quantitative scores, comparison tables, and detailed logs suitable for auditing and verification.

- [**Version 2 (with GAAF): The Explorer for Dynamic Landscapes**](./prompts/en/draco-agenttech-synthesis-framework-gaaf-en.md)
  This version is built for navigating **ambiguity, complexity, and rapid change**. It functions like a team of expert analysts debating a topic to uncover deep patterns and generate novel insights.

  - **Use When You Need:**
    - **Adaptive Exploration:** To analyze evolving topics where the framework must dynamically adjust its approach.
    - **Deep Interpretability:** To understand the "why" behind an analysis through a consensus-building process among AI agents (CPC).
    - **Creative & Strategic Insight:** For market analysis, policy forecasting, or brainstorming new strategies where there is no single right answer.
  - **Output Focus:** Provides a narrative of the analytical process, detailed footnotes with evidence, and ethical checks, emphasizing transparency of reasoning.

## Getting Started

- **Quick Start**: Copy the prompt from a Markdown file into a capable LLM (e.g., Grok-1.5+, GPT-4o). Provide a theme like "Impact of AI on global trade" to begin.
- **Implementation**: The framework utilizes `code_execution` for simulations (e.g., ANN passes). It requires a Python environment with NumPy/SciPy; an Acklam fallback is included for `ndtri`.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters directly in the prompt, such as `uplift: 1.05` or `norm_mode: 'null'`.
- **Contribute**: We welcome issues and PRs for refinements (e.g., new languages, domain adaptations). Test changes with Monte Carlo simulations (500-1000 reps; use a seed for reproducibility).

- **Empirical Pilots**: Conduct N=200-500 tests in finance/healthcare, integrating the IRIS framework.
- **Community Growth**: Encourage PRs for code, visualizations, and new analogs (e.g., arXiv:2505.11684).
- **Preprint Plans**: Submit refined versions to TechRxiv/arXiv sequentially.

This repository hosts the **Draco AgentTech Synthesis Framework**, a versatile agentic AI architecture for real-time analysis, decision support, and synthesis across domains like finance, policy, and creativity. It features two versions integrating Collective Predictive Coding (CPC), Agentic Neural Networks (ANN), and human-AI collaboration principles. As part of the **[Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster)**, Draco prioritizes ethical, adaptive, and transparent synergies.

**Elevator Pitch:** A self-evolving AI agent team that debates, predicts, and refines insights like a dynamic brainâ€”delivering clear, verifiable results with humans at the center.

**Notice and Updates:** Conceptual project; prompt-based blueprints for LLMs (e.g., Grok, GPT-4o, Claude). Simulations illustrative; no empirical claims. Updated October 15, 2025 (Version 1.1): Refined for clarity; added 2025 arXiv analogs from search (e.g., arXiv:2508.14825 on agentic AI in HAC).

```

- **Version 1 ([Draco with X-CII](./prompts/en/draco-agenttech-synthesis-framework-x-cii-en.md))**: Emphasizes safety via SDT and Expected Loss; multilingual (EN/JA/ZH/FR/ES/PT/KO) with fidelity scaling. Metrics: Median Relative X-CII ~107.2% [95% CI: 106.0-109.0%]; AUROC ~0.75-0.85. Use: High-stakes (e.g., healthcare explainability). Prompt: AI Proposal Mode; outputs summaries, tables, logs.
- **Version 2 ([Draco with GAAF](./prompts/en/draco-agenttech-synthesis-framework-gaaf-en.md))**: Focuses on dynamic thresholds and interpretability; VAE for synthetic data and CPC for consensus. Metrics: Variance/error thresholds (0.02-0.07); CAG scores â‰¥14/20. Use: General (e.g., market impacts). Prompt: AI Proposal Mode; outputs phases, footnotes, ethical checks.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Quick Start**: Copy prompt from Markdown file into LLM (e.g., Grok-1.5+). Provide theme like "Impact of AI on global trade".
- **Implementation**: Use code_execution for simulations (e.g., ANN passes). Requires Python with NumPy/SciPy; Acklam fallback for ndtri.
- **Customization**: Adjust parameters (e.g., uplift +5%, norm_mode 'null').
- **Contribute**: Issues/PRs for refinements (e.g., languages, domains). Test with Monte Carlo (500-1000 reps; seed for reproducibility).
